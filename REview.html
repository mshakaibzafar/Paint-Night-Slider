    <p>Alla was an awesome host for the Sip & Paint for our hybrid group of in office and virtual folks. They literally felt like they were all in one room. This was our second Ryptic event and I hope to continue using them for future office events.</p>

        <p>We just held our second event with Ryptic - they are great!  Our University club is virtual, so these events help us to stay connected.  We've done the paint night and the Office Olympics and the hosts from Ryptic are amazing!  It's shocking to me how fast an hour and a half go by with Ryptic - we've had so much fun!</p>

        <p>Our family immediately the next day went out and bought all the same materials and had a painting day. We've used 15 canvases in the 2 days following the event! Great session.</p>

        <p>I had a wonderful time painting and our host was wonderful ! however the small brush wasnâ€™t the best and it became a bit difficult to do a lot of the small detail work our painting required.</p>

        <p>"Overall the team really enjoyed the experience. Our host, Vic, was great - she played music in the background to give us some ambiance and was really encouraging to everyone. Several folks asked if we could do it again and even if there were options to switch up the mediums a bit like using oil paints, etc. Thanks for a fun event!"</p>

        <p>Paint night was really easy to follow along which made the experience very fun for someone who hasn't painted since elementary school. Was pretty surprised at my own ability and how the host walked through everything and cheered us on. Will definitely be hanging this on my wall! PS: didn't get a paint kit because I'm outside of the USA</p>

        <p>It was good, I'd be very happy to do another paint night. My only complaint was that I felt the "Detail brush"'s bristles were a bit too long, but that's super minor, and I should have used my own brush for that ðŸ™ƒ</p>

        <p>My coworkers and I did the "Escape the Mad Hatter" room in Mountain View. This was most of our group's first time doing an escape room, including myself, and I really loved the experience I had. I don't remember our host's name, but he was friendly and kind and provided us the four hints we were allowed to ask for in a way that didn't give away too much. We were thrilled (and surprised!) that we completed everything with about three minutes to spare! Would definitely recommend this escape room to friends.</p>

        <p>I enjo yed the session thoroughly. However, Zoom posed a little bit of a challenge. The screen kept flipping to various painters and not focused always on the instructor. So I had to toggle back/forth to the photo link of the object we were painting. Suggestion: If possible, place a 5x7" picture of the object being painted in the kit box. This way wealways have the photo guide in view at all times to reference. Overall, it was loads of fun.</p>

        <p>"Abby Hibbard made it super easy for us to book the event. I will say that I almost didn't reach out because it was so hard to find out how I could connect with a Booking specialist on the Ryptic website (I went to the website 4x in a week, and reviewed competitor websites because it was so hard to find an email/phone number I could reach out to). Really glad I didn't! It was a blast and the team loved it. We'll be back"</p>

        <p>The event was fun, the instructor was good. The paint kit was nice with the exception of the paint and brush quality. The paint was clumpy and a little dried out and the small brush was like a mop not allowing for the definition that was needed for item being painted.</p>

        <p>paintbrushes weren't appropriate for the painting (too long). some paint had dried up. Loved the box, made it feel like a special evening with friends.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s great. But the brushes are of poor quality. The hair kept coming off the brush when I painted.</p>

        <p>Natalie was great. She was very patient and explained the process well. I was nervous when I received a blank canvas, I usually get predawn so I can paint within the lines, but I was so proud of myself at the final result. Thank You Natalie!</p>

        <p>overall it was great. some of the team stated that their paint was a little dry and i think the brush sizes should be considered a bit more, but nothing that would keep me from doing it again.</p>

        <p>this is the second time we've used Ryptic as a team. the first time was for a virtual escape room and we all had an amazing time with it. this time, it was for the paint session and we didn't quite enjoy it as much. The packaging was nice. the facilitator (Alla) felt impersonal and rushed- which is what mostly made the experience not as pleasant .</p>

        <p>Nicole was our host for the night, I loved her cheerful attitude and encouraging energy. The virtual paint team building was a first for me and was a lot of fun. I understand the materials are not expected to be overly high quality, but I think the brushes could be upgraded a little. Overall I enjoyed my experience and would definitely recommend to other colleagues.</p>

        <p>I felt a bit rushed to do my painting since there was many steps to tackle. Perhaps, offer sessions with options to select of a 1-3 hours time slots. I felt the instructor did her part to offer help and provided suggestion to complete the painting. The paint quality could be stepped up a level. I would suggest offering plastic squeezable tubed paint since it would be an easier application on the palette panel. Also provide a variety of paint brush size. I suggest for the company to pick better quality of brushes. The paint brush bristles were falling off on my canvas, constantly, when painting.</p>

        <p>This is such a fun and well executed way to connect with your remote teammates in new ways.  It is low stress and inclusive to everyone.  Loved our experience, the hosts really make it top notch!</p>

        <p>"Definitely recommend the Ryptic Team Building Event! Had a blast with one of their events through a Trivia event via Zoom, and I must say this is one of the #funnest zoom events we had! Adam (Event host) is super friendly and has the best/wittiest comments! #TrulyAmazing #ZoomEvent #HighlyRecommend #FiveStars (Not sure if there are any other hosts, but definitely recommend Adam!)"</p>

        <p>Vic did a great job. Our group definitely wasn't the most talkative but I appreciate Vic's willingness to work with us. Regarding my paint kit, I noticed I was running quickly out of the paint that I needed since the mini jars were only half full.</p>
